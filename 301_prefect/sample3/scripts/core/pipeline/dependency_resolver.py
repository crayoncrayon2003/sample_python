    Resolves the execution order of pipeline steps.

    For the current implementation, the pipeline follows a simple linear
    sequence of steps as defined in the configuration file. This class

    complex dependencies (e.g., forming a Directed Acyclic Graph - DAG).

        the original list of steps, assuming a linear execution flow.

        Future implementations could analyze a 'depends_on' key within each
        step's configuration to perform a topological sort and determine the
